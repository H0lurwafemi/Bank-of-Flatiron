Bank Transaction Web App
This project is a React-based web application designed to help you practice working with components, props, state, events, and data fetching. It enables you to display and manage a list of your recent bank transactions.

Overview
The primary goal of this project is to reinforce your understanding of React concepts. Here, you'll develop a simple web app that allows users to view their recent bank transactions, add new transactions, and search for specific transactions.

Project Requirements
To successfully complete this project, you need to meet the following requirements:

Well-Written README: Ensure that your project includes a well-structured README file.

Data Fetching: Implement data fetching from a local server running a JSON DB server. This server should provide the necessary transaction data.

Project Setup: Properly set up your project by creating a new project folder and a private GitHub repository. Also, add your Teaching Mentor (TM) as a contributor to the repository for grading purposes.

Core Features
The core deliverables of this project include:

Transaction Table: Create a table that displays all the recent bank transactions.

Transaction Form: Develop a form that allows users to submit new transactions. These new transactions should be added to the table. Note that these new transactions do not need to be persisted to the backend.

Transaction Filtering: Implement a search bar that enables users to filter transactions by typing a search term. Only transactions with descriptions matching the search term should be displayed in the transactions table.
