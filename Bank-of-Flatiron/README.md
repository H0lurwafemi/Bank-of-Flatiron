Bank Transaction Web App
This project is a React-based web application designed to help you practice working with components, props, state, events, and data fetching. It enables you to display and manage a list of your recent bank transactions.

Overview
The primary goal of this project is to reinforce your understanding of React concepts. Here, you'll develop a simple web app that allows users to view their recent bank transactions, add new transactions, and search for specific transactions.


ASSIGNMENT INFO
Data Fetching: Implement data fetching from a local server running a JSON DB server. This server should provide the necessary transaction data.

Project Setup: Properly set up your project by creating a new project folder and a private GitHub repository. Also, add your Teaching Mentor (TM) as a contributor to the repository for grading purposes.
